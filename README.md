# EZAI-Web-Scraper

An API that allows you to scrape blog posts and articles and get a list of notes or a summary back.

### Enviroment Variables

OPENAI_API_KEY={YOUR API KEY} (Not required. Key can be provided in the request headers)

PORT={YOUR CHOSEN PORT} (Required)

### How To Run

#### Command Line

Developement: `npm run test`

Production: `npm run start`

#### Docker

_(Does not work on Apple M1 chips)_

CD into the "dist" folder and build the image.

Run the image, but make sure to include the enviroment variables.

I have tested this project on render.com and Google Cloud Run. Both work well and are a good choice.
